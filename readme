This project explores the relationship between traffic congestion and Uber’s business model. Using synthetic data and visualization techniques, it investigates how vehicle volume affects:

Fare prices through time-based pricing & surge multipliers

Customer behavior during peak hours & high-demand zones

Driver income in congested vs. peripheral areas

Key Insights:

Fares rise with increasing traffic volume and peak during commute hours (8–11 AM & 5–8 PM).

Urban centers report higher fares than peripheral junctions due to localized congestion.

While traffic boosts per-trip driver earnings, it reduces customer satisfaction and overall system efficiency.

Conclusion:
Traffic plays a direct and dynamic role in shaping Uber’s pricing algorithms, profitability, and customer experience.
